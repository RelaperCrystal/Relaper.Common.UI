# `Relaper.Common.UI`

This is a part of the `Relaper.Common` project that allows developers to have more control on User Interface part of the game. It wraps several scripting functions that isn't exists in the v3 API.

This project **does not** provide things like **menus**. To use menus and such, you'll need a menu library for that (e.g. LemonUI, NativeUI).

A RAGE port is considered.
